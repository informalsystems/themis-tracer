# Terminology

<a id="CONTEXT.1" class="lu-tag">|CONTEXT.1|</a>
: > from Latin contextus "a joining together," originally past participle of
  contexere "to weave together," from assimilated form of com "with, together"
  (see con-) + texere "to weave, to make"  ([etymonline](https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=context))
: A context gathers together the artifacts involved in an enterprise.
: Ideally a context is grounded in a [TERMINOLOGY.1][] and composed of all the
  intricate [traces][] that determine the relations between these
  artifacts. The traces should weave together all the influences from inception,
  to specification, to implementation, to documentation, to revision and
  iteration.
: At minimum, a context is a registry of [repositories][REPOSITORY.1].

<a id="TERMINOLOGY.1" class="lu-tag">|TERMINOLOGY.1|</a>
: > from Latin terminus "end, boundary line," in Medieval Latin "expression,
  definition," related to termen "boundary, end"
  ([etymonline](https://www.etymonline.com/word/term#etymonline_v_10648))
: Terminology delimits the bounds of signification, and describes the (relative)
  terminus for communicating with signs.
: We take terminology as a semiotic (de-reified) counterpart to the [reference
  models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_model) used in OOP and other
  realist requirement tracing frameworks.
