# Themis Tracer

Tracer is a prosthetic device for cultivating, and connecting within, the
[context](./specs/terminology.md#CONTEXT.1) of software development for
critical systems.

Tracer is designed to support _DOVES:dove:_: Development and Operations that are
Verifiable and Explicitly Specified ðŸ˜‰.

Tracer seeks to improve the productivity of distributed teams of developers by
supporting them throughout the development process and providing means to ensure
the correctness and continuity of communication, implementation, and operation.

Tracer aims...

- Maximally :: To enable formally specified and verified development of proven
  correct programs shaped through distributed and modular development.
- Minimally :: To provide the automated convenience of relevant information
  ready to hand while doing the work of specification, implementation,
  verification, and operation.

Tracer is developed by [Informal Systems'][informal].

**WARNING:** This project is still pre-alpha and nothing is stabilized,
from the tech stack and functionality to the project name. That said, early
adopters willing to [contribute](./CONTRIBUTING.md) or [give
feedback](https://github.com/informalsystems/themis-tracer/issues/new) are most
welcome ðŸ™‚.

## (Planned) Features

### **WIP** Context management

Manage multiple parallel contexts, spread across any number of repositories.

- [x] Enable switching between contexts.
- [ ] Support nested contexts, providing different perspectives to empower
      different kinds of work on the same domain.
- [ ] An integrated HUD showing key terminology, specifications, and diagrams,
      to support focused work and effective communication without noisy
      backchannels.

### **WIP** Tracing

Trace _logical units_ (chunks of functionality) through:

- [x] Human-language specifications (written in a slightly extended flavor of
      Markdown)
- [ ] Formal specifications (e.g. in TLA+)
- [x] Code (initially only in Rust)

### **TODO** Tracking

Automate the `specify -> formalize -> implement -> verify -> deploy -> revise`
life cycle, by tracking the flow of system properties from conception to
delivery and back again.

- [ ] Track the progress of logical units, getting a quick overview of
      units yet to be formalized/implemented/verified/deployed, and the level of
      progress towards implementation.

### **TODO** Monitoring

Verify coherence and consistency of your development with its context in CI

- [ ] Rationalize change management by catching unplanned changes to
      implementations, and flagging them for review by those responsible for
      implementation.
- [ ] Ensure implementations are kept up to date with changing specifications,
      by catching implementation units that get out of date with update
      specifications.

## Installation

The tool is currently in early development, so expect snags.

### Prerequisites

- [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html#installation)
- [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) (tested on pandoc >= 2.9)
- [sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) (tested on sqlite >= 3.33): You
  probably already have this on your system. Check with `sqlite3 --version`. If
  you need to install it, check you OS's package manager.

#### Optional

- [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/) (only needed for generating graphs)

### From git using cargo

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/informalsystems/themis-tracer.git
```

If this fails for any reason, please [open a
ticket](https://github.com/informalsystems/themis-tracer/issues/new) and try
installing from source, as documented in the next section.

### From source

```sh
git clone git@github.com:informalsystems/themis-tracer.git
cd themis-tracer
cargo install --path .
```

## Documentation

See the [CLI usage documentation](./tests/usage.md).

### Tutorial

#### Logical units in markdown

We make use of a variant of [PHP Markdown Extra's definition
lists][phpme-deflist] to define _logical units_ (i.e. requirements) in Markdown.

```markdown
# Specification

|SPEC-HELLO.1|
: When executed, the program must print out the text "Hello world!"
```

Logical units have unique identifiers associated with them. In this overly
simple case, we have the requirement labelled `SPEC-HELLO.1`. In order to
differentiate logical unit identifiers from ordinary [definition list
items][phpme-deflist], we enclose the tag in pipe symbols (`|`).

Each logical unit identifier must have a version number associated with it. In
this case, unit `SPEC-HELLO` has a version of `1` at present. This helps us
ensure that, when specifications change, we can automatically see which parts of
the code need to change too.

#### TODO

### Aliases and scripts

Useful bash functions and alias are collected in [./utils.sh](./utils.sh). You
might wish to source this from your rc file.
